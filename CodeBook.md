#Background

An experiment was conducted with 30 subjects performing six actitives which included walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying down. Each partispant wore there smartphone on their waist and daccelerometer and gyroscope data was collected from them. 70% of the test sujects were used for training data and the rest was used as test data. The data was stored into separate files label "test" and "training" data sets. The subjects ID were in a separate file and the signals labels were stored in a separate file. We were tasks to create a tidy data set using this files that extracts the mean and std per subject per activity of the signals from the accelerometers and gyroscopes.  

The final table should consist of a format similar to what's described below:

Subject_Id - This column identifed the 30 subject who was involed in the study

Activity - The column identifed the activity that was being conduct with the data was collected from the sensor

The rest of the columns where the data that was gotten from the sensors. The data from the sensors are listed below

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

Each axis data was placed in a column to itself.
